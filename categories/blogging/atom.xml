    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This should be and probably is my first post.</p>

<p>I decided to write this blog for several reasons.
  - to become a well recognized software developer.</p>

<p>  Why I think a well recognized developer should write a blog?
      I think it is very simple: to be recognized in a field one has to build the online presence.</p>

<p>  For several days I tried to write a well formed blog post about ? What I&rsquo;m doing right now - appeared to me the easiest way to start.
      But I&rsquo;m doing ordinary things and writing another blog, blog-post about &lsquo;How to configure my ~/vimrc file&rsquo; wasn&rsquo;t appealing to me.
      For several days I tried, thought about something that could drive me, push me to write a decent professional blog. The only thing
      coming to my mind was that it is not going to be easy - at least for me.</p>

<p>  Nothing. Still nothing. But I want to be a well grounded programmer.
      I came with another idea why write a blog and what could drive me for it.</p>

<p>  Documenting what I&rsquo;m developing, learning would help me to retain it, rethink, and possibly improve,
      make it better, push, drive me in to the programming heights. At the end it is what I want.
      By saying that I think this blog will be about my programming mainly, about what I&rsquo;m learning,
      what I want to remember and everything what is important to me.</p>
