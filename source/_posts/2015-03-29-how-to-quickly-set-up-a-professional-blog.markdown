# Requirements
  + It can't be a Wordpress or Blogger.
  + I don't want it to heavy - like  Rails or Sinatra.
  + I don't want to have a database.
  + I want to host it for free.
  + It has to be some  how geeky.
  + Easy to deploy but showing already some of my software or web dewelopment skills.

I had 2 options in my mind either Jekyll or Ghost
I'm a Ruby developer then Jekyll was my natural choice as Ghost is written in
Python.

Jekyll is a simple, static site generator with the possibility to be easilly
deployed to and hosted on GitHub's servers for free.

#Quick blog deployment using Octopress - a framework designed for Jekyll
