This should be and probably is my first post.

I decided to write this blog for several reasons. <!-- more -->
  - to become a well recognized software developer.

  Why I think a well recognized developer should write a blog?
      I think it is very simple: to be recognized in a field one has to build the online presence.

  For several days I tried to write a well formed blog post about ? What I'm doing right now - appeared to me the easiest way to start.
      But I'm doing ordinary things and writing another blog, blog-post about 'How to configure my ~/vimrc file' wasn't appealing to me.
      For several days I tried, thought about something that could drive me, push me to write a decent professional blog. The only thing
      coming to my mind was that it is not going to be easy - at least for me.

  Nothing. Still nothing. But I want to be a well grounded programmer.
      I came with another idea why write a blog and what could drive me for it.

  Documenting what I'm developing, learning would help me to retain it, rethink, and possibly improve,
      make it better, push, drive me in to the programming heights. At the end it is what I want.
      By saying that I think this blog will be about my programming mainly, about what I'm learning,
      what I want to remember and everything what is important to me.
